//THE TOURNAMENT METHOD
//assume, that the numbers are distinct and that n is a power of 2.
//we pair the keys and compare the pairs in rounds until only one round remains.
//if there are 8 elements then 4 comparison in first round,2 comparison in second and one in last.
//IT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE N IS A POWER OF 2.
//ELSE WE ADD ENOUGH ITEMS TO THE END OF THE ARRAY TO MAKE IT POWER OF 2.
